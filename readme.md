Exploratory Data Analysis in European Soccer Leagues with SQLite3

This database contains 8 different tables with the following features

- +25,000 matches
- +10,000 players
- 11 European Countries with their lead championship
- Seasons 2008 to 2016
- Players and Teams' attributes* sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates
- Team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates)
- Betting odds from up to 10 providers
- Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etcâ€¦) for +10,000 matches

The objective of this project is to provide some random insights using SQL queries and making good visualizations with data

In this project I run some queries with SQL commands then I visualize those queries to make the output more meaningful to the human eye.

Have fun!!
